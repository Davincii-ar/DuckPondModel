-The life cycle of ducks in the game:
 gray -> gray2 -> orange -> orange2 -> white(chief Duck)

-The ducks can leave the pond.

-The whistle (Quack) is done when a Chief Duck spawns.

-After the duck eats a lot of WATERLILIES, its size gradually increases and its color 
 also changes to become a white duck (chief duck) at the end.
